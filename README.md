# CHL5224H_ModernStatisticalGenetics

A collection of some of my coursework from Modern Statistical Genetics at the University of Toronto. More course information can be found at https://www.dlsph.utoronto.ca/course/statistical-genetics/. 

There are two projects currently listed in this repository. Both the `.RMD` files and the pdf reports can be seen for each project. It is recommended you view the pdf reports but if you are interested in the code used to generate any content in the PDFs, please refer to the `.RMD` files. The projects are as follows:

* GWASproject: In this project I used real Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sequencing data to investigate the type 1 error associated with genome wide association studies (GWAS). To do this, I randomly assigned invdividuals to either treatment or control groups (ie no actual correlation between any SNPs and group) and observed the number of SNPs that were erroneously correlated with the outcome.

* Minimum P-value: In this report, I investigate the influence of the minimum p-value approach using simulated trait and SNP data. The minimum p-value approach is when multiple types of gene inheretence patterns are simulatneously tested for staistical significance, and the lowest possible p-value is selected as the 'likely' inheretence pattern. We see how this insidious form of p-hacking can alter the type 1 error rate and how to adjust for it.
